Description
===========

Manage the install/update/uninstall of Pandoc extras (filters, templates, etc.)

What pandocpm is not
--------------------

Pandocpm does not replace your usual package manager: `pip`, `cabal`, etc.

In pandocpm, there are 2 kinds of packages: simple, or not simple.

-   A simple package means it is a single file, standalone package (e.g. a simple filter written in python that is a single file, a template which by its nature has to be a single file, etc.)

-   A non-simple package will be installed by external package managers, e.g. `pip` and `cabal`. pandocpm **do not** help you to install these package manager. It simply runs the neccessary commands to install a particular package. (And of course it won’t help you to resolve any dependencies issue either.) Helpful messages will be shown to direct you to install a particular package manager. See more below.

What is pandocpm then?
----------------------

It is designed to be a one-stop shop for any pandoc related packages, be it filters, templates, csl, panzer setup, etc. It

1.  automates the process of copying these packages, and
2.  provide a shortcut to commands required to install packages managed by other existing package managers.

Moreover, base on the infrastructure created in pandocpm, an auto-gallery will be provided for package discovery, which encourage code-reuse and to build upon one another’s workflow.

Install
-------

To install pandocpm, open the command line and type:

``` bash
pip install pandocpm
```

-   Requires Python 3.2 or later.
-   On windows, the command line (`cmd`) must be run as administrator.

To Uninstall
------------

    pip uninstall pandocpm

Dev Install
-----------

After cloning the repo and opening the pandoc-extras folder:

`python setup.py install`  
installs the package locally

`python setup.py develop`  
installs locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated
