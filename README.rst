Description
===========

Manage the install/update/uninstall of Pandoc extras (filters,
templates, etc.)

What pandocpm is not
--------------------

Pandocpm does not replace your usual package manager: ``pip``,
``cabal``, etc.

In pandocpm, there are 2 kinds of packages: simple, or not simple.

-  A simple package means it is a single file, standalone package
   (e.g. a simple filter written in python that is a single file, a
   template which by its nature has to be a single file, etc.)

-  A non-simple package will be installed by external package managers,
   e.g. ``pip`` and ``cabal``. pandocpm **do not** help you to install
   these package manager. It simply runs the neccessary commands to
   install a particular package. (And of course it won’t help you to
   resolve any dependencies issue either.) Helpful messages will be
   shown to direct you to install a particular package manager. See more
   below.

What is pandocpm then?
----------------------

It is designed to be a one-stop shop for any pandoc related packages, be
it filters, templates, csl, panzer setup, etc. It

#. automates the process of copying these packages, and
#. provide a shortcut to commands required to install packages managed
   by other existing package managers.

Moreover, base on the infrastructure created in pandocpm, an
auto-gallery will be provided for package discovery, which encourage
code-reuse and to build upon one another’s workflow.

Install
-------

To install pandocpm, open the command line and type:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pandocpm

-  Requires Python 3.2 or later.
-  On windows, the command line (``cmd``) must be run as administrator.

To Uninstall
------------

::

    pip uninstall pandocpm

Dev Install
-----------

After cloning the repo and opening the pandoc-extras folder:

``python setup.py install``
    installs the package locally
``python setup.py develop``
    installs locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated
